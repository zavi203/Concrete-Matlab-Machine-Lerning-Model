# Concrete-Matlab-Machine-Lerning-Model

This program creates a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the on the dataset provided. While trying to maintain as little of mean squared error as possible. A simple Linear regression machine learning model was developed.

This program was developed as a means for me to practice my programming skills in Matlab. A much more adavanced program I developed in python can be found here: https://github.com/zavi203/Concrete-Strength-Machine-Learning-Model.

Original paper: I-Cheng Yeh, "Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using artificial neural networks," Cement and Concrete Research, Vol. 28, No. 12, pp. 1797-1808 (1998).

Run the CDS.m file and feel free to play around with the hyperparameters of the program. Thank you :)
